# Aerofit---Descriptive-Statistics-Probability-.
Aerofit is a leading brand in the field of fitness equipment. Aerofit provides a product range including machines such as treadmills, exercise bikes, gym equipment, and fitness accessories to cater to the needs of all categories of people.

# Business Problem

The market research team at AeroFit wants to identify the characteristics of the target audience for each type of treadmill offered by the company, to provide a better recommendation of the treadmills to the new customers. The team decides to investigate whether there are differences across the product with respect to customer characteristics.

1. Perform descriptive analytics **to create a customer profile** for each AeroFit treadmill product by developing appropriate tables and charts.

2. For each AeroFit treadmill product, construct **two-way contingency tables** and compute all **conditional and marginal probabilities** along with their insights/impact on the business.

## Dataset

The company collected the data on individuals who purchased a treadmill from the AeroFit stores during the prior three months. The dataset has the following features:
